# Project Purpose and Goals

This Project is Instagram Replica.


**This is the client side**,


[**Here you can see the API**](https://github.com/yoavv2/instagram-api)


the Project includes 6 pages:

- signup,
- login pages (Password-based authentication),
- Feed page,
- single-post page,
- profile page,
- create-post page 

the goal of this project was to combine all the technologies and concepts I learned into one big project.

I chose to copy the Instagram UI design because I wanted to focus more on the app logic and less on the design.

still, I built the design using SCSS and not UI framework.
# The Stack and Explanation
  
 - React
 - Context API
 - SCSS

 
 # Problems and Throught Process
  
As my first large project using react I ran into a few bumps along the way, 

one particularly difficult area was the organization and structure of the code. 

Because of this project size, I realize how important maintaining an organized structure would be.
