the client-side.


the Project includes 6 pages:

- signup,
- login pages (Password-based authentication),
- Feed page,

the goal of this project was to combine all the technologies and concepts I learned into a one big project.

# The Stack and Explanation

 # Problems and Throught Process
  
As my first large project using react I ran into a few bumps along the way, 

one particularly difficult area was the organization and structure of the code. 

Because of this project size, I realize how important maintaining an organized structure would be.
